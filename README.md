# EyeQ - Eye Strain Detection Web App

## 🌟 Overview

EyeQ is a lightweight machine learning-powered web application designed to detect and predict levels of eye strain based on user input.  
It uses a Random Forest model trained on a cleaned eye strain dataset, with a simple Flask backend API for real-time predictions.

This project includes:
- A trained Random Forest model (`eye_strain_rf_model.pkl`).
- A Flask-based REST API (`app.py`) exposing a `/predict` endpoint.
- A cleaned dataset (`cleaned_eye_strain_dataset.csv`) used for training.
- A Jupyter notebook (`EyeQ.ipynb`) that covers model building, evaluation, and saving.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/eyeq-eye-strain-detection.git
cd eyeq-eye-strain-detection
```

### 2. Create a Virtual Environment and Activate It

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate    # For Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

### 3. Install Required Packages

First, create a `requirements.txt` file with the following:

```
flask
flask-cors
numpy
scikit-learn
joblib
```

Then install:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Run the Flask App

```bash
python app.py
```

Server will start at `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`.

## 🎯 API Usage

**Endpoint:**  
`POST /predict`

**Request JSON Format:**

```json
{
  "features": [feature1, feature2, feature3, ..., featureN]
}
```

**Example Request Using `curl`:**

```bash
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:5000/predict \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{"features": [0.5, 1.2, 3.4, 2.1]}'
```

**Example Response:**

```json
{
  "strain_level": 1
}
```

- `strain_level` is an integer predicting the level of eye strain.

## 📊 About the Dataset

- The dataset (`cleaned_eye_strain_dataset.csv`) contains cleaned and processed features linked to eye strain.
- Features include behavioral, environmental, and symptom-related attributes.
- The model (`eye_strain_rf_model.pkl`) was trained and validated using this dataset inside the `EyeQ.ipynb` notebook.

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Backend:** Python, Flask, Flask-CORS
- **Machine Learning:** scikit-learn (Random Forest Classifier)
- **Data Handling:** Numpy, Pandas (used in Jupyter Notebook)
- **Serialization:** joblib (for saving/loading the ML model)

---

## 📈 Future Improvements

- Create a ReactJS-based frontend for user interaction.
- Collect more data to improve model accuracy.
- Add advanced eye strain level classifications (mild, moderate, severe).
- Deploy using cloud platforms like AWS, GCP, or Render.
